# **TixClock**

The Tix Clock was originally sold in 2006 by ThinkGeek. Unfortunately, these are no longer sold. This project hopes to try to recreate this iconic clock in a miniature format.

# **TODO**
There are still things to do with this project which includes

 - Battery Management is not working
 - Encloser is not designed or tested
